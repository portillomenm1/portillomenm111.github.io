      <td>The IEEE Xplore journal talks about how Smart Irrigations play a part in agriculture. The system can use sensors and connects to devices all together to monitor soil, weather conditions, and plant growth. These systems could be programmed which this could be beneficial for farmers when it comes to saving water as it could prevent overflow and produce more crops.</td>

      <td>This site of the Global AG Tech Initiative also talks about how IoT is used in farming for different areas of farming. The article talks about the use of IoT in seeking crop precision, drone use and is also useful in livestock monitoring. IoT can monitor and measure crops, humidity, soil moisture and its nutrients. Even if IoT has developed and can be part of farming; the article also mentions that IoT could have issues such as connection, security and costs that not all farmers cannot have access to.</td>
